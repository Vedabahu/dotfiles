# All my dotfiles

### Done without GNU Stow

This repo contains all the dotfiles that I have used.
It is a bare repo and is very easy to use. I guess you have to clone it and see.

## Steps

- Install neovim, tmux, fish and some good nerdfont.
- `chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`
- open neovim, type :MasonInstallAll
- open tmux (restart the session), type `<Ctrl><Space>I`
